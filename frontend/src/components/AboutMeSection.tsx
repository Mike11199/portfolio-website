              <p>
                I'm Michael Iwanek and this is my portfolio website to showcase
                projects I've completed for personal learning and development.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm currently a Computer Science student at Oregon State
                University in an accelerated post-baccalaureate program. My
                first degree was in accounting, and after graduation I worked
                for about three years as a CPA in public accounting and
                government roles.
              </p>
              <p>
                I first discovered programming by self-teaching myself VBA to
                automate work tasks, and discovered how much I enjoy working
                through coding problems and building things.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of work and school, I enjoy rock climbing, skiing, and
                PC games. I'm hoping to eventually climb multi-pitch routes and
                get into back-country skiing one day.
