      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>
        I'm Michael Iwanek - and this is my portfolio website to showcase
        projects I've completed for personal learning and development. I've
        worked on these applications to keep my skills current, further practice
        what I've learned in my career, and sometimes to make something
        interesting for fun as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently employed as a full stack software engineer, and am a
        recent graduate from Oregon State University - where I obtained a B.S in
        Computer Science through an accelerated post-bacc program. My first
        degree was in accounting, and I successfully switched careers after four
        years as a CPA in public accounting and government roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first discovered programming by self-teaching myself VBA to automate
        work tasks, and discovered how much I enjoy working through coding
        problems and building things. I currently work on full stack
        applications using languages such as C#/.NET, Python, TypeScript,
        PostgreSQL, and others as needed for various projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work and school, I enjoy rock climbing, skiing, and PC games.
        I'm hoping to eventually climb multi-pitch routes and get into
        back-country skiing one day.
